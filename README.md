# 📈 Key Findings
   - The most dangerous phases of flight are **maneuvering and cruising**, which account for the highest number of fatal and serious injuries.
   - **Reciprocating engines** are linked to the largest share of crash incidents.
   - A significant portion of crashes result in **substantial or total destruction** of the aircraft.
   - The highest fatalities recorded are from ***CESSNA** manufactured aircrafts..


# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
